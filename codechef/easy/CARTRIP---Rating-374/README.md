## Problem

### Car Trip

Chef rented a car for a day.

Usually, the cost of the car is Rs $10$ per km. However, since Chef has booked the car for the whole day, he needs to pay for  **at least**  $300$ kms even if the car runs less than $300$ kms.

If the car ran $X$ kms, determine the cost Chef needs to pay.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $X$ - denoting the number of kms Chef travelled.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the cost Chef needs to pay.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
800
3
299
301
300

```

```
8000
3000
3000
3010
3000

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The car runs for $800$ kms. Thus, he needs to pay $800\cdot 10 = 8000$ rupees.

 **Test case $2$:**  The car runs for $3$ kms. However, since Chef booked the car for whole day, he needs to pay for at least $300$ kms. Thus, he needs to pay $300\cdot 10 = 3000$ rupees.

 **Test case $3$:**  The car runs for $299$ kms. However, since Chef booked the car for whole day, he needs to pay for at least $300$ kms. Thus, he needs to pay $300\cdot 10 = 3000$ rupees.

 **Test case $4$:**  The car runs for $301$ kms. Thus, he needs to pay $301\cdot 10 = 3010$ rupees.

 **Test case $5$:**  The car runs for $300$ kms. Thus, he needs to pay $300\cdot 10 = 3000$ rupees.

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t,x;
	scanf("%d", &t);
	for(int i=1;i<=t;i++)
	{
	    scanf("%d", &x);
	    if(x<=300)
	    printf("%d\n", 300*10);
	    else
	    printf("%d\n", x*10);
	}

}
