## Problem

### Interior Design

Chef decided to redecorate his house, and now needs to decide between two different styles of interior design.

For the first style, tiling the floor will cost $X_1$ rupees and painting the walls will cost $Y_1$ rupees.

For the second style, tiling the floor will cost $X_2$ rupees and painting the walls will cost $Y_2$ rupees.

Chef will choose whichever style has the lower total cost. How much will Chef pay for his interior design?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing $4$ space-separated integers $X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2$ as described in the statement.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the amount Chef will pay for interior design.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2 \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
10 20 9 25
10 20 9 20
10 20 20 10
100 43 85 61

```

```
30
29
30
143
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The first style costs $10 + 20 = 30$ rupees, and the second costs $9 + 25 = 34$ rupees. The first is cheaper, so Chef will pay $30$ rupees.

 **Test case $2$:**  The first style costs $10 + 20 = 30$ rupees, and the second costs $9 + 20 = 29$ rupees. The second is cheaper, so Chef will pay $29$ rupees.

 **Test case $3$:**  The first style costs $10 + 20 = 30$ rupees, and the second costs $20 + 10 = 30$ rupees. Both styles cost the same, so Chef is always going to pay $30$ rupees.

 **Test case $4$:**  The first style costs $100 + 43 = 143$ rupees, and the second costs $85 + 61 = 146$ rupees. The first is cheaper, so Chef will pay $143$ rupees.

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t,a,b,x,y;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d%d%d",&a,&b,&x,&y);
	    if((a+b)<(x+y))
	    printf("%d\n", a+b);
	    else
	    printf("%d\n", x+y);
	}

}
