## Problem

### Chef gives Party

Chef wants to give a burger party to all his $N$ friends i.e. he wants to buy  **one**  burger for each of his friends.

The cost of each burger is $X$ rupees while Chef has a total of $K$ rupees.

Determine whether he has enough money to buy a burger for each of his friends or not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains the three integers $N$, $X$, and $K$ - the number of Chef's friends, the cost of each burger, and the total money Chef has, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if the Chef can give a party to all his $N$ friends. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You may print each character of `YES` and `NO` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `Yes` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1000$
- $1 \le N, X \le 100$
- $1 \le K \le 10000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 10 70
5 10 40
10 40 400
14 14 150

```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:
- Test case $1$: Chef has $5$ friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be $10 \times 5 = 50$ while Chef has $70$ rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.
- Test case $2$: Chef has $5$ friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be $10 \times 5 = 50$ while Chef has $40$ rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.
- Test case $3$: Chef has $10$ friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be $40 \times 10 = 400$ and Chef has $400$ rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.
- Test case $4$: Chef has $14$ friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be $14 \times 14 = 196$ while Chef has $150$ rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.
