## Problem

### Volume Control

Chef is watching TV. The current volume of the TV is $X$. Pressing the `volume up` button of the TV remote increases the volume by $1$ while pressing the `volume down` button decreases the volume by $1$. Chef wants to change the volume from $X$ to $Y$. Find the minimum number of button presses required to do so.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ - the initial volume and final volume of the TV.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of times Chef has to press a button to change the volume from $X$ to $Y$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
50 54
12 10

```

```
4
2

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Chef can press the `volume up` button $4$ times to increase the volume from $50$ to $54$.

 **Test Case 2:**  Chef can press the `volume down` button $2$ times to decrease the volume from $12$ to $10$.

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t,x,y;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d",&x,&y);
	    if(x>y)
	    printf("%d\n",x-y);
	    else
	    printf("%d\n",y-x);
	}

}
