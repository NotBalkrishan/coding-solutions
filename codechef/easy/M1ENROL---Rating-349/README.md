## Problem

### MATH1 Enrolment

For the upcoming semester, the admins of your university decided to keep a total of $X$ seats for the `MATH-1` course. A student interest survey was conducted by the admins and it was found that $Y$ students were interested in taking up the `MATH-1` course.

Find the  **minimum**  number of  **extra**  seats that the admins need to add into the `MATH-1` course to make sure that every student who is interested in taking the course would be able to do so.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two-space separated integers on a single line, $X$ and $Y$ — the current number of seats up for enrolment and the number of students interested in taking up the course in the upcoming semester, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the  **minimum**  number of seats required to be added.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 10^5$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 1
12 34
50 49
49 50

```

```
0
22
0
1
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Exactly $1$ seat is available for enrolment, and exactly $1$ student is interested in taking up the course, hence addition of more seats is not required.

 **Test case $2$:**  $12$ seats are available for enrolment but $34$ students are interested in taking up the course, hence the admins would have to add $34-12=22$ more seats to make sure that every student interested in the course gets a seat.

 **Test case $3$:**  $50$ seats are available for enrolment and $49$ students are interested in taking up the course, hence addition of more seats is not required.

 **Test case $4$:**  $49$ seats are available for enrolment, but $50$ students are interested in taking up the course, hence the admins would have to add $50-49=1$ more seat to make sure that every student interested in the course gets a seat.

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t,x,y;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d",&x,&y);
	    if(y>=x)
	    printf("%d\n", y-x);
	    else
	    printf("0\n");
	}

}
