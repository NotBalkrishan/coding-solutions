## Problem

### Reach Home

Chef is hungry and wants to reach home.

Chef can travel up to $5$ kilometres on $1$ litre of fuel on his motorcycle.
Currently, his motorcycle is filled with $X$ litres of fuel and his home is $Y$ kilometres away.

Determine whether Chef can reach his home on his motorcycle or not.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the amount of fuel in Chef’s motorcycle and the distance to Chef’s home in kilometres.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES`, if Chef can reach home on his motorcycle. Otherwise output `NO`.

You can output each character of the answer in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `yEs`, `yes`, `Yes`, and YES are considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
2 10
3 17
4 2
6 45
```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  With $2$ litres of fuel, Chef can go up to $10$ kilometres. Since his home is $10$ kilometres away, he can reach his home on his motorcycle.

 **Test case $2$:**  With $3$ litres of fuel, Chef can go up to $15$ kilometres. Since his home is $17$ kilometres away, he cannot reach his home on his motorcycle.

 **Test case $3$:**  With $4$ litres of fuel, Chef can go up to $20$ kilometres. Since his home is $2$ kilometres away, he can reach his home on his motorcycle.

 **Test case $4$:**  With $6$ litres of fuel, Chef can go up to $30$ kilometres. Since his home is $45$ kilometres away, he cannot reach his home on his motorcycle.

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t,x,y;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d", &x,&y);
	    if((x*5)>=y)
	    printf("Yes\n");
