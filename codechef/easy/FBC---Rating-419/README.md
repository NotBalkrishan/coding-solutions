## Problem

### Fill the Bucket

Chef has a bucket having a capacity of $K$ liters. It is already filled with $X$ liters of water.

Find the  **maximum**  amount of extra water in liters that Chef can fill in the bucket without overflowing.

### Input Format
- The first line will contain $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers $K$ and $X$ - as mentioned in the problem.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line, the amount of extra water in liters that Chef can fill in the bucket without overflowing.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \lt K \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:

Output

```
2
5 4
15 6

```

```
1
9

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  The capacity of the bucket is $5$ liters but it is already filled with $4$ liters of water. Adding $1$ more liter of water to the bucket fills it to $(4+1) = 5$ liters. If we try to fill more water, it will overflow.

 **Test Case $2$:**  The capacity of the bucket is $15$ liters but it is already filled with $6$ liters of water. Adding $9$ more liters of water to the bucket fills it to $(6+9) = 15$ liters. If we try to fill more water, it will overflow.

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t,k,x;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d",&k,&x);
	    printf("%d\n",k-x);
	}

}
