## Problem

### Six Friends

Six friends go on a trip and are looking for accommodation. After looking for hours, they find a hotel which offers two types of rooms — double rooms and triple rooms. A double room costs Rs. $X$, while a triple room costs Rs. $Y$.

The friends can either get three double rooms or get two triple rooms. Find the minimum amount they will have to pay to accommodate all six of them.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ - the cost of a double room and the cost of a triple room.
### Output Format

For each testcase, output the minimum amount required to accommodate all the six friends.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \lt Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:

```

```
30
16
12

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  The friends can take three double rooms and thus pay a total of Rs. $30$.

 **Test case 2:**  The friends can take two triple rooms and thus pay a total of Rs. $16$.

 **Test case 3:**  The friends can take three double rooms and thus pay a total of Rs. $12$.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t,x,y;
	scanf("%d", &t);
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d", &x,&y);
	    if((3*x)>=(y*2))
	    printf("%d\n", y*2);
	    else
	    printf("%d\n", x*3);
	}

}
